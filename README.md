# TO-DO-list

# Step-by-Step Description of What Happened:

### ðŸ—‚ 1. **You Created the Files**

me made three files:

* `index.html` â†’ for structure (what users see)
* `style.css` â†’ for design (how it looks)
* `script.js` â†’ for behavior (how it works)

---

### ðŸ“„ 2. **Built the HTML Structure**

In `index.html`, you added:

* A **title** at the top.
* An **input box** to type tasks.
* An **"Add Task"** button.
* A **list (`ul`)** that will hold your tasks.

**This gave you a blank page with a place to enter and display tasks.**

---

### ðŸŽ¨ 3. **Styled the Page with CSS**

In `style.css`, you made the page look clean and modern:

* Centered everything.
* Added spacing and padding.
* Styled the button and task items.
* Made completed tasks look different (crossed out and green).

**This made the app look nice and easy to use.**

---

###  4. **Wrote the JavaScript to Make It Work**

In `script.js`, you added logic to make the app interactive.

Hereâ€™s what the JavaScript does:

#### a. **Add a Task**

* When you click "Add Task":

  * It checks if the input is not empty.
  * It creates a new list item (`<li>`).
  * Adds the task text.
  * Adds a **"Remove" button**.
  * Adds it to the list on the page.

#### b. **Mark Task Complete**

* When you click on a task, it **crosses it out** by adding a `completed` class using CSS.

####  c. **Remove a Task**

* When you click the **"Remove"** button next to a task:

  * It deletes that task from the page.

---

###  5. **Page Updates Instantly**

* All the actions (add, complete, remove) happen **immediately** without reloading the page.
* This is because of JavaScript â€” it lets the browser update the page dynamically.

---

### ðŸ§ª 6. **Tested with Live Server**

* You opened `index.html` using **Live Server** in **VS Code**.
* You tested:

  * Typing tasks and adding them.
  * Clicking to mark them complete.
  * Removing tasks.

## âœ… In Summary â€“ What You Built

You made a **fully working mini web app**:
